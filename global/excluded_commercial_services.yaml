excluded_services:
  - provider: Trimble Navigation Limited
    service: CenterPoint RTX
    reason: "Satellite-delivered PPP service, not primarily NTRIP-based"
    details: "While NTRIP delivery is available as backup to L-band satellite, the primary delivery method is proprietary satellite broadcast. RTX uses proprietary encrypted protocols (AES) that are Trimble-specific and not standard NTRIP RTCM format"
    delivery_methods:
      - "L-band satellite broadcast (primary)"
      - "NTRIP internet (backup only)"
    target_users: "Surveying, construction, agriculture, marine"
    coverage: "Global within 100 nautical miles of coastlines"
    accuracy: "2cm horizontal, 5cm vertical"
    pricing: "Included with select receivers purchased after April 1, 2024 (12 months)"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: "May reconsider if NTRIP becomes primary delivery method. Currently proprietary format limits utility for generic NTRIP clients"

  - provider: Fugro N.V.
    service: "Fugro Seastar, Marinestar, Starfix"
    reason: "Primarily satellite-delivered with NTRIP as backup only"
    details: "Fugro services use L-band satellite as primary delivery. NTRIP is offered as backup method over data delivery. Services are targeted at marine/offshore markets with specialized requirements"
    delivery_methods:
      - "L-band satellite (primary)"
      - "NTRIP (backup only)"
    target_users: "Marine, offshore, specialized applications"
    coverage: "Global marine coverage"
    pricing: "Enterprise/marine market pricing - not publicly available"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: "OmniSTAR service was acquired by Trimble in 2018. Current Fugro services are marine-focused"

  - provider: NovAtel/Hexagon
    service: TerraStar (Veripos)
    reason: "Primarily L-band satellite delivery, NTRIP as alternative"
    details: "TerraStar corrections are delivered worldwide through overlapping geostationary satellites directly to receivers. NTRIP is available as an alternative delivery method but not the primary focus"
    delivery_methods:
      - "L-band satellite (primary)"
      - "NTRIP cellular IP (alternative)"
    target_users: "Land, air, and nearshore (TerraStar); Offshore (Veripos)"
    coverage: "Global coverage via 100+ reference stations"
    accuracy: "2-50cm depending on service tier"
    services:
      - "TerraStar-C PRO (multi-constellation)"
      - "Veripos Ultra (offshore)"
      - "Veripos Apex (offshore)"
    pricing: "Contact NovAtel for pricing"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: "Part of Hexagon Positioning Intelligence division. May reconsider if NTRIP delivery becomes more prominent"

  - provider: John Deere
    service: StarFire
    reason: "Proprietary agricultural system, closed network"
    details: "StarFire is a proprietary GNSS correction service specifically designed for John Deere agricultural equipment. Not openly accessible via standard NTRIP protocols. Requires John Deere hardware and subscriptions"
    delivery_methods:
      - "Proprietary satellite delivery"
      - "Closed network system"
    target_users: "John Deere agricultural equipment only"
    coverage: "Agricultural markets where John Deere operates"
    pricing: "Bundled with John Deere equipment subscriptions"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: "Not a general-purpose NTRIP service. Equipment-specific and proprietary"

  - provider: u-blox/Sapcorda
    service: "SAPA (PPP-RTK)"
    reason: "Uses SPARTN proprietary format, not standard NTRIP RTCM"
    details: "SAPA service uses optimized SPARTN format for correction delivery rather than standard RTCM. While delivered via cellular/internet, it requires specialized receivers and format support. Not compatible with generic NTRIP clients"
    delivery_methods:
      - "SPARTN format via cellular"
      - "L-band satellite (planned)"
    target_users: "Automotive, industrial markets with compatible receivers"
    coverage: "Continental US and Europe (32 countries)"
    accuracy: "Fast convergence PPP-RTK, continental coverage"
    pricing: "u-blox acquired Sapcorda - pricing through u-blox channels"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: "SPARTN is an open format but not RTCM-compatible. May reconsider if RTCM/NTRIP delivery becomes available"

  - provider: Septentrio
    service: "Septentrio PolaRx/AsteRx integrated services"
    reason: "Receiver capability, not a correction service provider"
    details: "Septentrio receivers support NTRIP connections and can act as NTRIP casters/clients, but Septentrio itself is not a correction service provider. They partner with other correction services through their Agnostic Corrections Partner Program"
    target_users: "Industrial, automotive, UAV applications"
    notes: "Septentrio receivers work with correction services listed in the database (Skylark, SmartNet, TopNET, etc.)"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"

  - provider: Natural Resources Canada (NRCan)
    service: "CSRS-PPP"
    reason: "Post-processing service, not real-time NTRIP"
    details: "CSRS-PPP is a precise point positioning service that processes submitted RINEX files for post-processing. It is not a real-time NTRIP correction stream. Users submit data and receive processed results after computation (17-18 hours for Rapid, 12-15 days for Final products)"
    delivery_methods:
      - "Post-processing web service"
      - "RINEX file submission"
    target_users: "Surveying, geodetic control, research"
    coverage: "Global processing capability, Canadian reference frame"
    accuracy: "Centimeter-level post-processed"
    pricing: "Free government service"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: "Excellent free service but not real-time. Canadian RTK networks are commercial (Can-Net VRS, etc.)"

  - provider: Various Regional/State Networks
    service: "State-specific VRS networks without public NTRIP access"
    reason: "Subscription requires government/institutional affiliation or local residency"
    details: "Many state and regional networks exist but restrict access to government employees, licensed surveyors within jurisdiction, or require proof of local business/residency"
    examples:
      - "Some state DOT networks (USA)"
      - "Licensed surveyor-only networks"
      - "Institutional networks (universities, research)"
    target_users: "Government employees, licensed professionals within jurisdiction"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: "May document specific networks with clear public access policies in regional data files"

  - provider: Various Providers
    service: "Satellite-only correction services"
    reason: "No NTRIP delivery option available"
    details: "Services that exclusively use satellite delivery (L-band, Iridium, etc.) without any internet/NTRIP option. NTRIP Atlas focuses on internet-accessible NTRIP services"
    examples:
      - "Certain marine-specific L-band services"
      - "Satellite-only PPP services"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: "Services must have NTRIP delivery option to be included in database"

exclusion_criteria:
  reasons_for_exclusion:
    - criteria: "Non-NTRIP delivery method"
      description: "Service primarily uses proprietary protocols, satellite delivery, or other non-NTRIP methods"
      reconsideration: "If NTRIP becomes primary or equal delivery method"

    - criteria: "Proprietary format requirements"
      description: "Requires proprietary data formats incompatible with standard NTRIP clients (e.g., SPARTN without RTCM option)"
      reconsideration: "If standard RTCM/NTRIP support added"

    - criteria: "Closed/restricted access"
      description: "Service requires specific hardware, institutional affiliation, or is not publicly accessible"
      reconsideration: "If access policy changes to allow general public registration"

    - criteria: "Post-processing only"
      description: "Service provides post-processing but not real-time corrections"
      reconsideration: "Not applicable - different use case than NTRIP Atlas targets"

    - criteria: "Pricing not available"
      description: "Enterprise-only services without publicly documented pricing or access methods"
      reconsideration: "If public access tier or transparent pricing becomes available"

    - criteria: "Insufficient geographic coverage"
      description: "Service covers only very limited area without clear expansion plans"
      reconsideration: "As coverage expands to useful geographic scope"

review_schedule:
  - "Quarterly review of excluded services for inclusion reconsideration"
  - "Annual review of exclusion criteria and policies"
  - "Community feedback on services to reconsider"
  - "Monitor service announcements for NTRIP delivery additions"

notes: |
  This exclusion list is maintained to document commercial services that were
  researched but not included in the active database. The goal is transparency
  about what was considered and why certain services don't fit the current
  NTRIP Atlas mission.

  Services on this list may be reconsidered for inclusion if:
  - They add standard NTRIP delivery options
  - They adopt standard RTCM formats alongside proprietary formats
  - Access policies change to allow general public registration
  - Geographic coverage expands significantly

  The NTRIP Atlas project welcomes community input on services that should be
  reconsidered or additional services to evaluate for inclusion.
