excluded_services:
  - provider: Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI)
    country: Japan
    network_name: GEONET
    reason: Restricted NTRIP access requiring formal application
    details: >
      GSI operates 1300+ CORS stations across Japan. Real-time NTRIP access via terras.gsi.go.jp
      requires formal registration and application. Japanese residents can register at
      https://terras.gsi.go.jp/ftp_user_regist.php while overseas users must submit application
      forms. RINEX data (30-second interval) available via FTP with delays. Real-time NTRIP uses
      ports 2101 (unencrypted) or 443 (TLS). Supports NTRIP 1.0 and 2.0. Service quality: 5/5.

  - provider: National Geographic Information Institute (NGII)
    country: South Korea
    network_name: NGII CORS Network
    reason: Incomplete technical information
    details: >
      NGII provides integrated GNSS CORS service covering South Korea with 4,282 control points.
      Network RTK positioning provides 1-second correction data with ±2cm horizontal and ±4cm
      vertical accuracy in testing. Standard NTRIP port 2101 likely used but specific hostname
      and mountpoint details not publicly documented. Registration likely required but process
      unclear. Service quality: 5/5.

  - provider: Academia Sinica Institute of Earth Sciences
    country: Taiwan
    network_name: Academia Sinica GNSS Network
    reason: Research network - not public NTRIP service
    details: >
      Academia Sinica operates GNSS stations and processes data from 115+ continuous GNSS
      network stations in Taiwan for research purposes. Data managed through Taiwan GPS
      Monitoring (TGM) datacenter federation. This is primarily a research data collection
      network, not a public real-time NTRIP correction service. Taiwan's public e-GNSS
      service operated by NLSC already included.

  - provider: Department of Survey and Mapping of Vietnam
    country: Vietnam
    network_name: Vietnam CORS Network
    reason: Incomplete technical information and language barriers
    details: >
      Vietnam has established National RTK Network for high-precision GNSS applications.
      Registration required but website navigation reported as difficult. Specific NTRIP
      caster hostname, port, and mountpoint information not publicly available in English.
      Service supports surveying and mapping applications including real-time landslide
      monitoring. Further investigation needed with Vietnamese language expertise.

  - provider: Committee of Geodesy and Cartography
    country: Kazakhstan
    network_name: Kazakhstan National GNSS Network
    reason: Limited NTRIP availability for public use
    details: >
      Kazakhstan operates approximately 10 operational CORS stations covering densely
      populated and economically active regions, with ~50 stations under development.
      Uses ITRF, WGS 84, Pulkovo 42, and SK-95 reference systems. As of 2024, comprehensive
      public NTRIP service availability not confirmed. Users may need to rely on free
      global correction services with nearby base stations (RTK limited to 35-50 km range).

  - provider: Survey of Pakistan
    country: Pakistan
    network_name: Pakistan CORS Network and Pak-SBAS
    reason: Limited public information and emerging infrastructure
    details: >
      Pakistan operates Karachi CORS network with 5 stations providing heightened positional
      accuracy. Pakistan Satellite-Based Augmentation System (Pak-SBAS) planned for launch
      by 2024, providing sub-meter accuracy for public service and decimeter accuracy for
      authorized PPP services. First SBAS using BeiDou PPP-B2b signal. NSDI feasibility
      study ongoing. Specific NTRIP public access details not yet documented.

    details: >
      Research identified Survey of Bangladesh as potential geodetic service provider.
      No public information found regarding operational CORS network or NTRIP services
      during 2024 investigation. May have limited geodetic infrastructure or restricted
      access. Further investigation needed with local expertise.

  - provider: Papua New Guinea Geodetic Survey
    country: Papua New Guinea
    network_name: PNG CORS Network
    reason: No public NTRIP service information found
    details: >
      Pacific Island nation with potential geodetic infrastructure needs. No public
      information found regarding operational CORS network or NTRIP services during
      2024 investigation. May benefit from regional Pacific geodetic initiatives similar
      to Fiji's CORS network supported by Pacific Community.

notes: >
  Many Asia-Pacific countries operate government geodetic infrastructure but do not provide
  publicly accessible NTRIP services or have unclear registration/access procedures. Language
  barriers (particularly for services in Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, and Central Asian countries)
  make it difficult to verify access requirements and connection details. Several countries
  identified as having emerging CORS infrastructure that may become publicly accessible in future.

  Community contributions welcome for any services listed here if access information becomes
  available or if local expertise can clarify registration procedures.
