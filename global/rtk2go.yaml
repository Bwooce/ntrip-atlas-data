  # Known limitations and notes
  notes: |
    - Largest global community NTRIP network
    - Quality varies by individual base station operator
    - Some base stations may be temporary or intermittent
    - Excellent for global roaming and testing
    - Best effort availability - not guaranteed
    - Free service with simple email-based authentication
    - Great fallback option when commercial services unavailable
