    notes: |
      - New NTRIP caster launched May 2024 (ntrip.earthscope.org)
      - Supports RTCM 3.3 and BINEX formats
      - Mount point format: {FCID}_RTCM3P3
      - Ports: 2101 (RTCM), 2105 (BINEX), 2110 (RTX)
      - Data latency: 0.2-2.0 seconds
      - Requires re-registration for new caster
      - Legacy caster rtgpsout.earthscope.org deprecated
      - Funded by NSF with support from NASA and USGS
      - Coverage concentrated in seismically/volcanically active areas
      - Not all US states have stations - focused on scientific research
