      - NIGNET: Nigerian GNSS Network operational since 2008
      - Operated by Office of the Surveyor General of the Federation (OSGoF)
      - 11 CORS stations: Abuja (OSGoF), Port Harcourt (RUST), Gembu (HATC), Lagos (UNILAG)
      - Additional stations: Kebbi (WUFP), Zaria (ABU), Yola (FUTY), Enugu (UNEC), Calabar (UNICAL), Toro (CGG), Maiduguri
      - NTRIP implementation successfully tested with CLBR mountpoint
      - Real-time correction streaming demonstrated with Trimble R8 receivers
      - Station spacing >300km, covers approximately 25% of Nigeria currently
      - Linked to ITRF2008 via 9 International GNSS Service (IGS) stations
      - ±20mm RTK positioning accuracy capability
      - Nigeria Geocentric Datum (NGD) reference system
      - Expansion planned: 165 additional CORS stations from 2021+
      - Part of Africa's geodetic infrastructure development
      - Contact OSGoF for access to developing NTRIP services
      - Collaboration with Trimble Navigation and SEGAL (Space & Earth Geodetic Analysis Laboratory)
