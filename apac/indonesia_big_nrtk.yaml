      - InaCORS: Indonesian Continuously Operating Reference Station network
      - Operated by BIG (Badan Informasi Geospasial) Geospatial Reference System Directorate
      - Multiple service types available:
        * MAX: Network RTK selecting highest quality reference station
        * i-Max: Network RTK using nearest reference station
        * VRS: Virtual Reference Station corrections
        * Nearest Base RTK: Single RTK correction from one base station
      - Network RTK provides corrections from maximum 5 nearby stations
      - Accuracy: 10mm + 1.0ppm in ideal conditions (single RTK)
      - Real-time station connectivity status monitoring available
      - Phase ambiguity resolution reliable within 50km range
      - Ionosphere, troposphere, and satellite orbit modeling included
      - Registration required at nrtk.big.go.id for NTRIP access
      - Service quality depends on local telecommunications infrastructure
      - Part of Indonesian Spatial Reference System (SRGI) infrastructure
