excluded_services:
  # Federal networks without real-time NTRIP service
  - provider: "NOAA CORS Network (NCN)"
    country: "US"
    reason: "Post-processing only, no real-time NTRIP service provided directly by NOAA"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"

  # Peru REGPMOC
  - provider: "Instituto Geográfico Nacional del Perú"
    country: "PE"
    service_name: "REGPMOC - Red Geodésica Peruana de Monitoreo Continuo"
    reason: "NTRIP hostname not publicly accessible, requires registration through IGN Peru"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      75 permanent tracking stations (ERP) in REGPMOC network.
      Network provides geodetic infrastructure for Peru.
      Real-time corrections likely available but access details not public.
      Contact IGN Peru directly for NTRIP credentials.
    notes: |
      NOAA's Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) Network provides GNSS data for
      post-processing only. The NCN prototype real-time service was discontinued due to low usage
      and staff limitations. However, many state DOTs and research organizations use CORS data to
      provide their own RTK/RTN streaming services. See UNAVCO/EarthScope for federal real-time access.

  # US States with paid-only or no public CORS networks
  - provider: "California Caltrans RTN"
    country: "US"
    region: "California"
    reason: "Restricted access - Caltrans internal use and vetted data sharing partners only"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      All Caltrans RTN networks operated by District 6 Surveys office. Created through data sharing
      partnerships with local, state, and federal agencies. Only accessible by Caltrans departments
      and public partners vetted through data sharing agreements. Not available for general public use.

  - provider: "Texas TxDOT GPS Network"
    country: "US"
    region: "Texas"
    reason: "Post-processing focus, no public real-time RTK service"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      194 high-accuracy base stations (Regional Reference Points). Participating in NOAA CORS network.
      Base station data available for post-processing differential corrections. System focuses on
      post-processing rather than real-time RTK services for general public.

  - provider: "Pennsylvania State CORS"
    country: "US"
    region: "Pennsylvania"
    reason: "No state-operated public RTK network"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      Pennsylvania has no public RTK correction service operated by state government. PennDOT maintains
      CORS infrastructure (including University of Pittsburgh partnership) but no statewide public NTRIP
      service. Users must rely on commercial providers (KeyNetGPS, AlphaRTK) or NOAA CORS for post-processing.

  - provider: "Illinois State CORS"
    country: "US"
    region: "Illinois"
    reason: "No state-operated public network - commercial only"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      Illinois IDOT does not operate a public CORS/RTK network. ReIL-NET (operated by Kara Company, Inc.)
      is a private commercial service with 55+ base stations. Offers free and paid subscription services
      but is not a government-operated network.

  - provider: "Georgia GDOT GPS Network"
    country: "US"
    region: "Georgia"
    reason: "No state-operated public CORS NTRIP network identified"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      GDOT allows GPS RTK/VRS for photogrammetric activities but explicitly prohibits GPS Reference
      Network/RTK for establishing project control on Department projects. No dedicated GACORS network
      found. Commercial services (eGPS Solutions Georgia RTK Network) available but not government-operated.

  - provider: "Colorado CDOT CORS"
    country: "US"
    region: "Colorado"
    reason: "No comprehensive state CORS network - limited public access"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      Colorado has limited public RTK networks (Mesa County RTVRN - Trimble network, and PBO single
      baseline stations). No comprehensive state DOT CORS NTRIP network like other states. Mesa County
      provides RTVRN service but only for county area, not statewide.

  - provider: "Nevada NVCORS/NNCRN"
    country: "US"
    region: "Nevada"
    reason: "Network transferred to Utah TURN GPS - paid service"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      Northern Nevada Cooperative Real Time Network (NNCRN/NVCORS) transferred to Utah's Automated
      Geographic Reference Center management. Now part of Utah TURN GPS network (paid subscription).

  - provider: "Utah TURN GPS Network"
    country: "US"
    region: "Utah"
    reason: "Paid subscription service, not free public access"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      Utah Reference Network (TURN) operated by Utah Geospatial Resource Center. Trimble Pivot VRS Platform.
      Covers Utah plus portions of Idaho, Wyoming, southern Nevada. High-precision centimeter positioning
      but requires yearly subscription fee. Not a free public service.

  - provider: "Washington State Reference Network (WSRN)"
    country: "US"
    region: "Washington"
    reason: "Operated by Seattle Public Utilities, usage fee required"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      WSRN operated by Seattle Public Utilities (not WSDOT). Trimble network system requiring usage fee.
      Available as Pivot network but not a free public service. While WSDOT has GPS infrastructure,
      primary public CORS/NTRIP is the paid WSRN service.

  # Canadian provinces - mostly commercial networks
  - provider: "Ontario Commercial RTK Networks"
    country: "CA"
    region: "Ontario"
    reason: "Commercial subscription-based services only"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      Ontario has multiple commercial RTK providers (SmartNet/HxGN, Can-Net, BrandtNet) requiring paid
      subscriptions. Network RTK services in Canada primarily provided by private industry with compliance
      agreements with NRCan for NAD83(CSRS) integration. No free public provincial network.

  - provider: "British Columbia Commercial RTK Networks"
    country: "CA"
    region: "British Columbia"

    notes: |
      BC has SmartNet, Can-Net, BrandtNet, TopNet commercial providers. Province has RTK survey guidelines
      and High Precision Networks (HPN) as part of BC ACSm initiatives. Southern BC networks successful but
      all require subscriptions. No free public provincial network.

  - provider: "Alberta Provincial GNSS Network"
    country: "CA"
    region: "Alberta"
    reason: "Commercial service providers only, no public provincial RTK network"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      Alberta relies on commercial network RTK services. Government of Alberta coordinates spatial
      referencing system. Alberta Survey Control (ASC) network: ~27,500 survey control points but not
      real-time RTK. Commercial providers deliver RTK services. Can-Net operates 300+ stations across
      Canada including Alberta coverage.

  - provider: "Quebec MERN GNSS Network"
    country: "CA"
    region: "Quebec"
    reason: "Free access but NOT using NTRIP protocol"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      18 active GNSS stations maintained by Ministère de l'Énergie et des Resources naturelles (MERN).
      Free real-time access via wireless internet for single-base RTK. However, data is NOT broadcast
      using NTRIP protocol. Uses CMR+ or RTCM V3.2 via cellular telephony from IP addresses. Different
      connection method incompatible with standard NTRIP Atlas discovery.

  - provider: "Saskatchewan Commercial Networks"
    country: "CA"
    region: "Saskatchewan"
    reason: "Commercial service providers only"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"

  # Mexico - commercial networks
  - provider: "Red CORS México (Commercial)"
    country: "MX"
    reason: "Commercial paid subscription service"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      Largest commercial CORS network in Mexico with 85+ cities coverage. Monthly or annual membership
      required. INEGI-compliant coordinates. ±1cm accuracy up to 40km from stations. Compatible with most
      GNSS RTK receivers and drones. Not a free public service, though coordinates are georeferenced to
      INEGI standards.

  - provider: "Mexico INEGI Government Network"
    country: "MX"
    reason: "Research incomplete - public NTRIP service details unknown"
    last_verified: "2024-12-01"
    notes: |
      Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI) is Mexico's national geodetic authority.
      Commercial networks claim INEGI compliance but direct public NTRIP service from INEGI itself
      not confirmed in research. Further investigation needed for government-operated services.
